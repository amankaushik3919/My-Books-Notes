Title: <u>The Big Picture</u>

> The most effective way to understand how an operating system works is through abstraction—a fancy way of
> saying that you can ignore most of the details. For example, when you ride in a car, you normally don’t need
> to think about details such as the mounting bolts that hold the motor inside the car or the people who build
> and maintain the road upon which the car drives. If you’re a passenger in a car, all you really need to know is
> what the car does (transports you somewhere else) and a few basics about how to use it (how to operate the
> door and seat belt).
> But if you’re driving a car, you need to know more. You need to learn how to operate the controls (such as the
> steering wheel and accelerator pedal) and what to do when something goes wrong.
