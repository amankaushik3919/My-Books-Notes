Title: Memory Management
```

The Kernel must manage memory during a context switch, it has a complex job of memory management. The kernel's job is complicated because the following conditions must hold:

- The kernel must have its own private area in memory that user processes can not access.
- Each user process needs its own section of memory.
- One user process may not access the private memory of another process.
- User processes can share memory.
- Some memory in user processes can be read-only.
- The system can use more memory than is physically present by using disk space as auxiliary.


For the kernel Now there is help. Modern CPUs include a `memory management unit(MMU)` that enables a memmory access scheme called `virtual memmory.`

When using virtual memory, a process does not
directly access the memory by its physical location in the hardware. Instead, the kernel sets up each process
to act as if it had an entire machine to itself. When the process accesses some of its memory, the MMU
intercepts the access and uses a memory address map to translate the memory location from the process into
an actual physical memory location on the machine. The kernel must still initialize and continuously maintain
and alter this memory address map. For example, during a context switch, the kernel has to change the map
from the outgoing process to the incoming process.


> NOTE :- The implementation of a memory address map is called a page table.
