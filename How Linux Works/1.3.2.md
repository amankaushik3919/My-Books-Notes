Title: Memory Management
```

The Kernel must manage memory during a context switch, it has a complex job of memory management. The kernel's job is complicated because the following conditions must hold:

- The kernel must have its own private area in memory that user processes can not access.
- Each user process needs its own section of memory.
- One user process may not access the private memory of another process.
- User processes can share memory.
- Some memory in user processes can be read-only.
- The system can use more memory than is physically present by using disk space as auxiliary.
