<h1 style="font-size:25px;"> Levels and Layers of Abstraction in a Linux System  </h1>


A `Layer or level` is classification or grouping of a component according to where that component sits between the user and the hardware.

- Web Browsers, games and such sit at the top layer; at the bottom layer we have the memory in the computer hardware - the 0s and 1s. The operating system occupies most of the layers in between.

Three main levels in the _Linux System_. 
1. [Hardware](https://github.com/amankaushik3919/My-Books-Notes/blob/main/How%20Linux%20Works/Hardware.md) at the base.
2. [kernel](https://github.com/amankaushik3919/My-Books-Notes/blob/main/How%20Linux%20Works/kernel.md) is the next level.
3. [Processes](https://github.com/amankaushik3919/My-Books-Notes/blob/main/How%20Linux%20Works/Process.md) :- The running programs that the kernel manages - collectively make up the system's upper level, called _user space_. 

---

There is a critical difference between the ways that the _kernel_ and user processes run: 

The kernel runs in kernel mode, and the user processes run in _user mode_.

The area that only the kernel can access is called kernel space.
