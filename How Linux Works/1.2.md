Hardware : Understanding Main Memory

Of all of the hardware on a computer system, main memory is perhaps the most important. In its most raw form, main memory is just a big storage area for a bunch of 0s and 1s. Each 0 or 1 is called a bit.

Note: Because it is common to refer to the state in abstract terms rather than to the actual bits, the term image refers to a particular physical arrangement of bits.
