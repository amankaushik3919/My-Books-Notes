Title: The Kernel
```
- Kernal Taks
    - split memory into many subdivisions, and it must maintain certain state info. about those subdivisions at all times.
    - Each process get its own share of memory and the kernel must ensure that each process keeps to its share.

Kernel is the incharge of managing tasks in 4 general system areas:
- [Processes](./Process.md). The kernel is responsible for determining which processes are allowed to use the CPU.
- ```Memory``` The kernel needs to keep track of all memory what is currently allocated to a particular process, what might be shared between processes, and what is free.
- ```Device drivers``` The kernel acts as an interface between [hardware](./Hardware.md) (such like a disk) and [processes](./Process.md). It is usually the kernel's job to operate the hardware.
- ```System calls and support``` Processes normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel.
